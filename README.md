# C201 Reading Notes

## *This is where I will put all my notes I guess...*

Hello, My name is Tim Traylor (he/him). Currently living in Edmonds, Washington State. I am a 12 year Navy veteran, submarine nuclear electrician. Currently running Windows 10. Excited to see what area of coding and software development speaks to me. Limited tech background, but have always been able to build computers and fix small issues. Would like to continue to learn and open remote work possibilities in the future.
Please, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and/or GitHub.

**Growth mindset** is the idea that I know that I am constantly growing and learning. *It is okay to fail*, but never okay to quit. Continue to improve daily and a month from now, you will be surprised.

### Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset

* Nothing comes easy
* Try to remember every one started at square one
* Focus on small wins, they win the war
