## JavaScript [Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

### Questions

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    * grouping of variables and functions inside a tool which can be used, changed, referenced
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    * write out the object contents as you come to create it
    * when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
    * sending single object is more efficient than sending several items individually
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    * when object property name is defined at runtime
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    * refers to the object it is part of; can access parts in the same object and report out
