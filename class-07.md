# Notes for Class 07

## [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

### Questions

1. Explain why we need domain modeling
    * Gives an easy way to store objects with similar data and allows us to manipulate them

## [HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

### Questions

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    * tables are supposed to hold tabular data and will not work right with other data
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML '<'table>.
    * ```<table>``` itself is semantic and creates a table
    * ```<th>``` semantic and creates labels for data
    * ```<tr>``` container for all elements in that 1 row
    * ```<col>``` container for all elements in that 1 column

## [Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

### Questions

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    * lets you reuse code for objects to save time, and computer processing power
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    * SAME

## [Object Prototypes using a Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

### Questions

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
*NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question*
    * Prototype is property that every function in JS has and allows us to share methods across all instances of function
    * An analogy for prototype inheritance could be a library. Anyone can go into the library and check out a few books, but it would be impractical for one individual to try to check out every book from the library at once. Prototypes allow the developer to only call the methods that they need.
